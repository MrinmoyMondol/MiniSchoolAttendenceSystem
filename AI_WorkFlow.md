1. Which parts you used AI assistance for (Claude Code/Cursor/ChatGPT)

Ans.I used AI (ChatGPT) to generate boilerplate code, fix routing issues, structure the Vue/Laravel project setup, and troubleshoot build errors. 
    It also helped in writing clean components, API integration patterns, and improving overall architecture.


2. 3 specific prompts you used and how they helped

Ans. “How do I integrate Laravel with a separate Vue.js front-end setup?”
This helped me correctly configure Vite, set up the frontEnd directory, and understand how to load Vue pages independently from Laravel Blade routes.

“How do I load Dashboard.vue on the homepage instead of the default Laravel welcome page?”
This prompt guided me through adjusting the router configuration, removing the default Laravel route, and ensuring the Vue router controlled the front-end navigation.

“How do I fix [plugin:vite:import-analysis] errors and resolve missing component paths?”
This helped me solve Vite import issues, correct file paths such as App.vue, and successfully mount the Vue app to the DOM.

Although Vue.js is not my strongest area, I made the best use of my time to learn quickly and complete as much of the task as possible within the given deadline. With proper time and guidance, I am confident that I can fully adapt to this technology and continue improving my skills rapidly.

3. How AI improved your development speed

Ans.  AI reduced trial-and-error, automated repetitive tasks, and provided instant debugging solutions. 
       Instead of searching documentation for every issue, I received clear, direct fixes, which significantly accelerated my workflow.


4. What you manually coded vs AI-generated
Ans. Manually coded: Business logic, component structure, UI layout, Vue/Laravel controllers, and the final implementation details.

     AI-generated: Scaffolding templates, troubleshooting steps, optimized configurations, and improved code snippets for routing, API setup, and deployment.
